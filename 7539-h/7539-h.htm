<br />Let blockheads read what blockheads wrote
<br />Life of ignorance is not only a very contemptible, but tiresome
<br />Listlessness and indolence are always blameable
<br />Little minds mistake little objects for great ones
<br />Little failings and weaknesses
<br />Loud laughter is the mirth of the mob

<br />Make a great difference between companions and friends
<br />Make himself whatever he pleases, except a good poet
<br />Make yourself necessary
<br />Make every man I met with like me, and every woman love me
<br />Man is dishonored by not resenting an affront
<br />Man or woman cannot resist an engaging exterior
<br />Man of sense may be in haste, but can never be in a hurry
<br />Man who is only good on holydays is good for very little
<br />Mangles what he means to carve
<br />Manner is full as important as the matter
<br />Manner of doing things is often more important
<br />Manners must adorn knowledge
<br />Many things which seem extremely probable are not true
<br />Many are very willing, and very few able
<br />Mastery of one's temper
<br />May you live as long as you are fit to live, but no longer!
<br />May you rather die before you cease to be fit to live
<br />May not forget with ease what you have with difficulty learned
<br />Mazarin and Lewis the Fourteenth riveted the shackles
<br />Meditation and reflection
<br />Mere reason and good sense is never to be talked to a mob
<br />Merit and good-breeding will make their way everywhere
<br />Method
<br />Mistimes or misplaces everything
<br />Mitigating, engaging words do by no means weaken your argument
<br />MOB: Understanding they have collectively none
<br />Moderation with your enemies
<br />Modesty is the only sure bait when you angle for praise
<br />Money, the cause of much mischief
<br />More people have ears to be tickled, than understandings to judge
<br />More one sees, the less one either wonders or admires
<br />More you know, the modester you should be
<br />More one works, the more willing one is to work
<br />Mortifying inferiority in knowledge, rank, fortune
<br />Most people enjoy the inferiority of their best friends
<br />Most long talkers single out some one unfortunate man in company
<br />Most ignorant are, as usual, the boldest conjecturers
<br />Most people have ears, but few have judgment; tickle those ears
<br />Much sooner forgive an injustice than an insult
<br />My own health varies, as usual, but never deviates into good
<br />Mystical nonsense
<br />Name that we leave behind at one place often gets before us
<br />National honor and interest have been sacrificed to private
<br />Necessity of scrupulously preserving the appearances
<br />Neglect them in little things, they will leave you in great
<br />Negligence of it implies an indifference about pleasing
<br />Neither know nor care, (when I die) for I am very weary
<br />Neither abilities or words enough to call a coach
<br />Neither retail nor receive scandal willingly
<br />Never would know anything that he had not a mind to know
<br />Never read history without having maps
<br />Never affect the character in which you have a mind to shine
<br />Never implicitly adopt a character upon common fame
<br />Never seek for wit; if it presents itself, well and good
<br />Never to speak of yourself at all
<br />Never slattern away one minute in idleness
<br />Never quit a subject till you are thoroughly master of it
<br />Never maintain an argument with heat and clamor
<br />Never seem wiser, nor more learned, than the people you are with
<br />Never saw a froward child mended by whipping
<br />Never to trust implicitly to the informations of others
<br />Nipped in the bud
<br />No great regard for human testimony
<br />No man is distrait with the man he fears, or the woman he loves
<br />No one feels pleasure, who does not at the same time give it
<br />Not tumble, but slide gently to the bottom of the hill of life
<br />Not to communicate, prematurely, one's hopes or one's fears
<br />Not only pure, but, like Caesar's wife, unsuspected
<br />Not make their want still worse by grieving and regretting them
<br />Not making use of any one capital letter
<br />Not to admire anything too much
<br />Not one minute of the day in which you do nothing at all
<br />Notes by which dances are now pricked down as well as tunes
<br />Nothing in courts is exactly as it appears to be
<br />Nothing much worth either desiring or fearing
<br />Nothing so precious as time, and so irrecoverable when lost
<br />Observe, without being thought an observer
<br />Often more necessary to conceal contempt than resentment
<br />Often necessary, not to manifest all one feels
<br />Often necessary to seem ignorant of what one knows
<br />Oftener led by their hearts than by their understandings
<br />Old fellow ought to seem wise whether he really be so or not
<br />One must often yield, in order to prevail
<br />Only doing one thing at a time
<br />Only because she will not, and not because she cannot
<br />Only solid and lasting peace, between a man and his wife
<br />Our understandings are generally the DUPES of our hearts
<br />Our frivolous dissertations upon the weather, or upon whist
<br />Out of livery; which makes them both impertinent and useless
<br />Outward air of modesty to all he does
<br />Overvalue what we do not know
<br />Oysters, are only in season in the R months
<br />Passes for a wit, though he hath certainly no uncommon share
<br />Patience is the only way not to make bad worse
<br />Patient toleration of certain airs of superiority
<br />Pay your own reckoning, but do not treat the whole company
<br />Pay them with compliments, but not with confidence
<br />People never desire all till they have gotten a great deal
<br />People lose a great deal of time by reading
<br />People will repay, and with interest too, inattention
<br />People angling for praise
<br />People hate those who make them feel their own inferiority
<br />Perfection of everything that is worth doing at all
<br />Perseverance has surprising effects
<br />Person to you whom I am very indifferent about, I mean myself
<br />Pettish, pouting conduct is a great deal too young
<br />Petty jury
<br />Plain notions of right and wrong
<br />Planted while young, that degree of knowledge now my refuge
<br />Please all who are worth pleasing; offend none
<br />Pleased to some degree by showing a desire to please
<br />Pleased with him, by making them first pleased with themselves
<br />Pleasing in company is the only way of being pleased in yourself
<br />Pleasure and business with equal inattention
<br />Pleasure is necessarily reciprocal
<br />Pleasure is the rock which most young people split upon
<br />Pleasures do not commonly last so long as life
<br />Pocket all your knowledge with your watch
<br />Polite, but without the troublesome forms and stiffness
<br />POLITICIANS NEITHER LOVE NOR HATE
<br />Prefer useful to frivolous conversations
<br />Prejudices are our mistresses
<br />Pride remembers it forever
<br />Pride of being the first of the company
<br />Prudent reserve
<br />Public speaking
<br />Put out your time, but to good interest
<br />Quarrel with them when they are grown up, for being spoiled
<br />Quietly cherished error, instead of seeking for truth
<br />Read my eyes out every day, that I may not hang myself
<br />Read with caution and distrust
<br />Real merit of any kind will be discovered
<br />Real friendship is a slow grower
<br />Reason ought to direct the whole, but seldom does
<br />Reason, which always ought to direct mankind, seldom does

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
